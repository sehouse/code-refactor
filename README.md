# code-refactor

Commit 1:
Initial upload of the project and associated files.

Commit 2:
Worked on index.html and style.css to remove some div elements and combine them into a header. These included the h1 and ul situated within the header. I also changed the title of the page from "website" to "Horiseon".

Commit 3: 
Turned the .hero div into its own section. The .content div was also turned into its own section. The three div contained within that section were turned into article. "online-reputation-management" and "social-media-marketing" were changed from id to class.

Commit 4:
Added alt text for the three article images. "search-engine-optimization" is "Optimization Chart". "online-reputation-management" is "Reputation Graph". "social-media-marketing" is "Social Media Buzzwords".

Commit 5:
Turned the benefits div into an aside. The div within benefits all were changed to articles. Added alt text for the images within these articles. "lead-generation" is "Generate Customers". "brand-awareness" is "Increase Visibility". "cost-management" is "Decrease Marketing Costs". Changed title to "Horiseon Social Solution Services". Moved the aside css elements after the section/article css elements, so that it matches the flow of the html code.
