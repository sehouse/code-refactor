# code-refactor

Commit 1:
Initial upload of the project and associated files.

Commit 2:
Worked on index.html and style.css to remove some <div> elements and combine them into a <header>. These included the <h1> and <ul> situated within the <header>. I also changed the title of the page from "website" to "Horiseon".

Commit 3: 
Turned the .hero <div> into its own section. The .content <div> was also turned into its own <section>. The three <div> contained within that section were turned into <article>. "online-reputation-management" and "social-media-marketing" were changed from id to class.
